# âš½ Applied Statistical Modeling: International Football Analysis

This project explores over **150 years of international football data** to uncover key statistical patterns across elite national teams. Using statistical modeling techniques, the project delivers actionable insights into match outcomes based on historical performance, location, and tournament context.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The dataset includes match data from 1872 to 2024 for top-tier national teams such as:
- Argentina
- France
- Spain
- England
- Brazil

Using **logistic regression**, **T-tests**, and **ANOVA**, the project analyzes:
- Match outcomes (win, draw, loss)
- Influence of match location (home, away, neutral)
- Tournament context (friendly, World Cup, continental championships)
- Performance trends across different eras

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- Teams exhibit statistically significant performance trends based on **location** â€” home advantage is real and measurable.
- Certain **eras** reflect changes in dominance, potentially influenced by coaching philosophy, player generations, or tactical shifts.
- **Historical context** (e.g., tournament type) has a measurable impact on match outcomes.

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion

These insights can empower:
- **Coaches & analysts** to tailor tactics based on opponent trends and contextual strengths.
- **Fans & commentators** to better understand shifts in national team performance.
- **Betting markets & bettors** to make more informed predictions using data-driven insights.

Understanding team strength in historical context and match conditions offers a **tactical edge** â€” on the pitch, and beyond.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, T-tests, ANOVA, Data Visualization
